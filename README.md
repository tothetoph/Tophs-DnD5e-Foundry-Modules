# Tophs-DnD5e-Foundry-Modules

I'd like to preface this by saying that this is the setup that works for my group's personal needs, and it may not be reflective of what everyone wants within Foundry. If you are new to Foundry, welcome! This is an amazing community, and I'm super happy that you came across this repo. That being said, I'd highly recommend starting out with the core Foundry application and only adding modules if you absolutely know what they do and what problems they solve. Additionally, unless you're willing to sit down and debug for a while, I'd recommend sticking to module versions that you've worked with and have tested as opposed to updating on a whim. I'm as guilty as anyone of clicking that super convenient "Update All" button to pull the most recent module versions, but more often than not, it's led to more issues than anything else.

For those that are new to Foundry, before looking for new modules, I highly recommend checking out Encounter Library's Foundry VTT Basics playlist. He breaks things down extremely well and touches on pretty much everything you need to know to get your first session underway.
